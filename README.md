# MnistSycl

This repo contains mutiple implmentations of a neural network that is trained on the Mnist data set. 
The different implementations can be viewed on seperate branches.
* sequential: Whole implementation is sequential with with raw for loops
* algorithm: Same as sequential but instead of raw for loops uses the algorithm header from C++ standard library
* (unavailable) sycl: Uses the sycl api to accelerate the neural network on the gpu
